# DriveBuddy bookings system

How a booking travels from a customer's phone to a driver, and how to set it up.
**Running cost: ₹0. No card needed.** Everything runs on free Google services.

```

- The website stays a static site on GitHub Pages (free).
- Firestore stores everything (free up to 50,000 reads and 20,000 writes a day; DriveBuddy uses a few thousand).
- The alerts robot is a Google Apps Script attached to a Google Sheet. It runs on Google's servers every minute, so alerts arrive **within a minute even when every laptop and phone is off**. It also writes each booking into the Sheet, so you can read them like Excel.
- Apps Script on a normal Gmail account allows 90 minutes of automatic runs a day and 100 emails a day. The robot uses roughly 30 minutes a day and one email per booking.

## Data model

| Collection | One document per | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bookings/{id}` | booking | customer (create), robot (ref, alerts), admin (status, driver) | admin; the customer who made it while logged in |
| `bookings/{id}/events/{id}` | change or internal note | robot, admin | admin only |
| `drivers/{id}` | driver application | applicant (create), admin (status, note) | admin |
| `customers/{phone}` | customer, by mobile number | robot only | admin |
| `users/{uid}` | login account | that customer | that customer, admin |
| `admins/{email}` | admin Google account | robot's `setup` (or the Firebase console) | that admin, to check their own access |
| `meta/counters` | — | robot only | nobody from a browser |

**Booking lifecycle:** `new → confirmed → assigned → completed`, or `cancelled` from any open state. Completed and cancelled bookings can be reopened.
**Driver lifecycle:** `new (applied) → verified → active ⇄ inactive`, or `rejected`. Only `active` drivers can be assigned.

Design choices, and why:

- **Bookings are never deleted**, only cancelled, so the history stays complete.
- **One customer record per phone number**, so five guest bookings from one person are one customer.
- **Internal notes live in the admin-only timeline**, never on the booking, because a logged-in customer can read their own booking.
- **Admin access is an entry in `admins/`**, created from the robot's `ADMIN_EMAILS` property. No email address is written in the code or the rules.
- **Each change and its timeline entry are saved together** (one batch from the admin panel, one commit from the robot), so the history can never disagree with the booking.
- **The robot runs under a lock** and only numbers bookings that have no number yet, so a booking is never numbered or alerted twice.

`firestore.rules` enforces all of this. `tests/rules/rules.test.mjs` checks every role against it (`npm run test:rules`, needs Java). `scripts/alerts-script.test.mjs` runs the robot against a simulated Firestore (`npm test`).

## One-time setup (about 20 minutes)

Use the Google account that **owns the Firebase project** (Firebase console → ⚙ Project settings → Users and permissions → Owner).

**1. Turn on Google login (free).** Firebase console → Authentication → Get started → Sign-in method → **Google** → Enable → Save. Then Authentication → Settings → Authorized domains → Add domain → `thedrivebuddy.in`.

**2. Make your Telegram bot.** In Telegram, open **@BotFather**, send `/newbot`, choose a name (e.g. *DriveBuddy Alerts*) and a username ending in `bot`. Copy the token it gives you (looks like `123456:ABC-xyz`). Then open your new bot, press **START** and send `hi`.

**3. Create the alerts robot** (with the Firebase owner account).
1. Go to https://sheets.new and name the sheet **DriveBuddy Bookings**.
2. Extensions → **Apps Script**. Click *Untitled project* at the top and rename it **DriveBuddy**. Delete the sample code. Open `apps-script\Code.js` from this repo in Notepad, copy everything, and paste it in.
3. ⚙ Project Settings → tick **Show "appsscript.json" manifest file in editor**. Back in the editor, open `appsscript.json` and replace its contents with `apps-script\appsscript.json` from this repo. Save (Ctrl+S).
4. Reload the Sheet. A **DriveBuddy** menu appears → **Connect Telegram and start**. Google asks for permission: choose your account → *Advanced* → *Go to DriveBuddy (unsafe)*: it is your own script → Allow. Run the menu item again, paste the bot token from step 2, OK.
5. You get "All set ✅", Telegram gets "DriveBuddy alerts are connected", and the Sheet fills with every booking so far.

Optional script properties (⚙ Project Settings → Script properties): `ADMIN_EMAILS` (who can open `/admin`; default: the account that owns the script; several allowed, comma-separated — run the menu item again after changing it) and `ALERT_EMAIL` (where alert emails go; `none` turns email off).

**4. Publish the security rules.** Firebase console → Firestore Database → **Rules** → replace everything with the contents of `firestore.rules` → **Publish**. (Or from `C:\git\drivebuddy`: `npx firebase-tools login` then `npm run deploy:backend`.) No indexes are needed: every query is on one field.

**5. Publish the website:** `git push`. Then open https://thedrivebuddy.in/admin/, sign in with the admin Google account, and make a test booking from your phone. It should reach Telegram and the Sheet within a minute.

### If setup shows an error

- **"Firestore 403 … permission"**: the script is running under a Google account that is not an Owner of the Firebase project. Use the owner account, or add this account as Owner in Firebase → Users and permissions.
- **"No Telegram chat found"**: open the bot, press START, send `hi`, and run **Connect Telegram and start** again.
- **A row in the Sheet looks wrong, or you deleted rows**: DriveBuddy menu → **Refresh the whole sheet**.

## Everyday use

- **New booking:** Telegram buzzes (plus email, plus a new row in the Sheet). Tap *Open in admin panel*, or call the number in the message.
- In `/admin` the top tiles are shortcuts (*New – call now*, *Needs action*, *Booked today*). The table works like a spreadsheet: filter by status, city and date, search, click a column heading to sort, click a row for details. The **Next step** button on each row does the usual move in one click: **Confirm** → **Assign driver** → **Complete**. **Excel** downloads exactly the rows you are looking at.
- **The Google Sheet** is a live copy kept by the robot: newest bookings on top, a colour per status, filter buttons on every column, and a **Summary** tab (today, this week, this month, by city, by package, by month). Status and driver changes from `/admin` reach it within a minute. Add your own columns (e.g. *Paid?*) anywhere; the robot never touches them. Treat the robot's columns as read-only: change bookings in `/admin`.
- A booking left "New" for 10 minutes sends one reminder to Telegram.
- **New driver application:** Telegram alert and a row in the *Drivers* sheet. In the Drivers tab: Verify (after the ID and police check) → Activate.
- To add another admin later: add the email to the `ADMIN_EMAILS` script property and run **Connect Telegram and start** again.

## Optional paid upgrades

- **Phone + SMS-code login:** Firebase charges per SMS, and it needs the Blaze plan with a card. Switch to Blaze, enable *Phone* under Authentication → Sign-in method, and set `login.phoneOtp: true` in `site-settings.ts`.
- **Alerts in seconds instead of within a minute:** Cloud Functions (Blaze). The full version is in git history, commit `1115476`.
